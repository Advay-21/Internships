# Internships

During my internship at **Adani Electricity**, I focused on data analytics for electricity demand forecasting, working extensively with large-scale, half-hourly time series datasets covering demand and market prices for the NSW1 region. My responsibilities included acquiring, cleaning, and preprocessing these datasets using Python, performing exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and anomalies, and preparing the data for advanced forecasting models such as Prophet. I contributed to building and validating predictive models that decomposed demand into trend and seasonal components, enabling accurate future demand estimation and supporting data-driven decision-making for utility operations. This role provided me with hands-on experience in energy sector analytics, time series modeling, and the practical application of data science in real-world utility management.

At **IIT Bombay**, I developed a lightweight, real-time stereovision surveillance system for people and object tracking using live camera feeds, with a focus on computational efficiency for edge device deployment. My work encompassed building modules for gaze detection, face and pose recognition, relative velocity estimation, and person re-identification across single and dual camera setups. I implemented classical image processing techniques and optimized the software pipeline to minimize memory and processing requirements, enabling reliable tracking and identification even in resource-constrained environments. This internship deepened my expertise in computer vision, real-time video analytics, and the integration of AI-powered surveillance solutions for smart security applications.

During my winter internship at **PwC** in the Advisory division (One Consulting), Mumbai, I immersed myself in a comprehensive learning and professional development journey, guided by experienced mentors and industry leaders. I completed rigorous training modules covering Ethics & Compliance, SQL & Power BI, Automation Testing, Advanced Excel, Python for Data Analysis, Pharma Sector insights, and Government Client Engagement, which provided me with a strong foundation in both technical and consulting skills. Beyond structured coursework, I gained hands-on experience by working on real-world applications, including developing machine learning models for fraud detection, conducting stock market data analysis using quantitative techniques, and performing customer segmentation through unsupervised learning. These projects allowed me to apply Python and machine learning to solve practical business challenges, further sharpening my analytical and problem-solving abilities. My time at PwC not only strengthened my technical expertise but also gave me valuable exposure to the consulting environment, collaborative teamwork, and client-focused project delivery, preparing me for future roles in data science and business analytics.

During my ongoing internship at **EY**, I have been deeply involved in research and data analysis projects within the consulting and risk advisory domains, focusing on the manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors. My responsibilities have included compiling and validating detailed datasets of leading companies—mapping plant locations, product portfolios, and tier classifications—using advanced Excel and research techniques. I have also contributed to industry and technology risk assessments, exploring challenges such as AI governance, data privacy, and cybersecurity, and recommending mitigation strategies aligned with industry best practices. This experience has enhanced my analytical and business communication skills, given me valuable exposure to EY’s client service standards, and allowed me to collaborate closely with professionals on the preparation of client-ready deliverables, positioning me for deeper involvement in live consulting projects as my internship progresses.
